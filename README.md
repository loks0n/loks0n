# Hi there!

I'm a engineer from Nottingham, UK ðŸ‡¬ðŸ‡§ and Iâ€™m based in Cambridge.

Iâ€™m been building since I was in high-school, coding websites, Minecraft mods and more. My classmates used my old school flash-games arcade site to chat and avoid doing work on school computers. I studied Computer Science at University, and went on to write  distributed e-commerce systems at a company called [THG](https://www.thg.com/). Now, I'm building the future of cloud at [Appwrite](https://appwrite.io).
