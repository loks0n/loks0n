Hey - I'm an engineer based in Cambridge, UK ðŸ‡¬ðŸ‡§.

Iâ€™m been building since I was in high-school, coding websites, Minecraft mods and more. My classmates used my old school flash-games arcade site to chat and avoid doing work on school computers. I studied Computer Science at University, and went on to write distributed e-commerce systems at [THG](https://www.thg.com/). Now, I'm building the cloud of the future as a Platform Engineer at [Appwrite](https://appwrite.io).
